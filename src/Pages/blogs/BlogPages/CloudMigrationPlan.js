              In today’s competitive climate, businesses need to capitalize on
              the benefits of moving to the cloud in order to drive digital
              change and improve overall operations. <br />
              <br />
              Now that cloud computing has become a standard in the enterprise
              space, we are seeing more and more businesses moving towards it.
              In many areas, the need to migrate to cloud is so pressing that
              some people would rather move forward with one or two unknown
              risks than remain in their current hosting environment. While this
              can have its risks, migrating to the cloud also has numerous
              upsides which makes it worthwhile to consider. It’s just important
              to approach this process with a clear plan and methodology in
              place – one that not only takes into account IT implications but
              business as well.

              Many companies — in nearly every industry — are increasingly
              adopting cloud technologies. In fact, 94 percent of organizations
              are using cloud services in some way.
              <br />
              For most businesses, the decision to migrate to the cloud is a
              natural progression: It’s an opportunity to modernize IT
              infrastructure, increase operational efficiency and create a more
              flexible and scalable environment for future growth. It’s also a
              chance to take advantage of improved disaster recovery
              capabilities that enable faster resumption of operations without
              costly in-house data centers. <br />
              <br />
              But while there is plenty of evidence that moving to the cloud can
              save money and improve business agility, there are risks
              associated with any major transition. So when you’re considering a
              move to the cloud, it’s important to make sure you have a clear
              understanding of the challenges involved. Here are three steps
              that will help you navigate a successful migration or transition:{" "}

              The following are some of the most commonly used approaches to
              modernizing enterprise applications: <br />
              <br />
              Refactor Applications: Make sure they’re optimized for cloud
              deployment by breaking them down into smaller pieces with
              distributed architectures (microservices) and using container
              technology such as Docker and Kubernetes (modernize with
              containers) or PaaS solutions such as AWS Lambda (modernize with
              serverless). This is a great approach for legacy applications that
              have a long lifecycle but aren’t being maintained regularly
              because it helps overcome many of the issues. <br />
              <br />
              When planning a cloud migration, there are many things to
              consider. Which applications should be moved? Should the entire
              data center be migrated? What are the costs and benefits of
              various cloud scenarios (e.g., public, private and hybrid clouds)?{" "}

            To help you cover all your bases, here’s a quick checklist for cloud
            migration: <br />
            <br />
            Step 1: Identity what you want to migrate. This is perhaps the most
            important thing to decide as it will impact how much time and money
            it takes to migrate. <br />
            <br />
            Step 2: Determine if you want a hybrid or single-cloud solution.
            Hybrid solutions can be more costly in terms of time and money, but
            might make sense for certain applications. <br />
            <br /> Step 3: Create a proof of concept (PoC) plan that explains
            how your application will perform in the cloud. This will give you
            real-world insight before committing to a full migration. <br />
            <br />
            Step 4: Create a migration plan that includes step-by-step
            instructions on how you will move applications and data, who will do
            it, when it will be done, etc. <br />
            <br /> Step 5: Test everything prior to migration. Then once your
            application is migrated into the cloud, test again to make sure
            everything works properly in this new environment. <br />
            <br />
            Hopefully, this guide has provided you with the basic knowledge
            necessary to successfully cloud migrate your business or
            organization. While the process can be difficult, it also presents
            many advantages to businesses and organizations that are willing to
            weather the transition period. If this article was helpful to you,
