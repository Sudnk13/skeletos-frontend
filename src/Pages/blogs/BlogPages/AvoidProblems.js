                <li className="h6 fw-bold">Time Restriction</li>Software must be
                developed in a particular timeframe but when you’re dealing with
                international clients managing time gets a bit complicated due
                to different Timings. Having a different schedule may lose
                productivity at work. A developer may work under pressure to
                meet the expectation level and find it very hard to complete its
                task in a particular timeframe. <br />
                <br />
                <li className="h6 fw-bold">Bounded Infrastructure</li>If you
                want to execute your project properly then you might need some
                extra resources and IT infrastructures. You need
                High-performance computing programs, Data storage architectures.

                affected to the performance of employees. Many organizations
                don’t have them and they outsource them. It saves up to 60 % of
                the time and automatically improves their productivity. <br />
                <br />
                <li className="h6 fw-bold">Clashes Between Teams</li>There are
                many chances that clashes will happen between the software
                development team and Testing teams. It mostly happened because
                of the different mindsets of both teams. Both teams are under
                pressure and have different job roles. If these clashes are not
                being handled then it may cause serious problems in our project.
                And it won’t be possible to meet deadlines.
