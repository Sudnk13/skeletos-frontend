              When it comes to migrating to the Cloud (or any type of data
              migration for that matter), it’s easy for an organization to get
              excited about the possibilities and just dive in — but this can
              feel more like an expensive and painful experience than an
              investment. That’s why it’s important to slow down and think about
              what needs to take place before putting all your eggs in one big
              bucket. Here are some tips on how to effectively approach cloud
              migration. <br />

              It’s not easy moving your business to the cloud. There are a
              variety of things you need to think about when you’re receiving
              your data in the cloud and more than likely running it through an
              API of some kind to extract information. There are also several
              challenges involved when migrating to the cloud that you need to
              think about
            </p>

              <br />
              <span className="h5">Analyze your current applications</span>
              <br />
              It is essential to devise a detailed strategy before migrating
              your business operations to the cloud. That strategy starts with
              deciding what to do with your current on-prem applications. It
              will require an in-depth understanding of your existing business
              challenges and future goals because not every application will
              need to be migrated. It depends entirely on the vision set forth
              by your company and what you hope to accomplish by moving to the
              cloud. <br />
              <br />
              <span className="h5">Get input from employees</span>
              <br />A common mistake when moving to the cloud (and implementing
              any organizational change) is discussing the upcoming changes with
              your employees. They are the ones who can tell you which
              applications you NEED to migrate to the cloud. Just because your
              organization is paying for something does not mean that your
              employees are fully utilizing it. <br />
              <br />
              <span className="h5">Use a hybrid model</span>
              <br />
              The public cloud has many benefits, but there are instances where
              an on-prem model is better suited for the job at hand. That’s why
              it’s crucial for businesses to have a clear understanding of their
              needs before adopting one or the other. The best solution is often
              utilizing both models – a hybrid approach – which can help protect
              against unnecessary costs while delivering maximum flexibility and
              scalability. A hybrid cloud also creates greater redundancy across
              data <br />
              <br />
              <span className="fw-bold text-primary">Don't</span>
              <br />
              <br />
              Making a mistake in the cloud can be costly. Here are some things
              to avoid when migrating to a cloud environment. <br />
              <br /> <span className="h5">Not planning for future growth</span>
              <br />
              One of the big benefits of moving to the cloud is the scalability
              it offers. You have access to compute resources as and when you
              need them, and that means you can scale up or down depending on
              demand. <br />
              However, if you don’t plan effectively, you may end up with an
              environment that doesn’t scale in a way that suits your needs. By
              calculating anticipated growth and accounting for spikes in
              demand, you’ll be able to ensure that your cloud deployment will
              grow with you. <br />
              <br />
              <span className="h5">Not considering costs</span>
              <br />
              The cost of public cloud services is well-known – if not always
              well understood. However, if you don’t do your sums properly and
              budget for the ongoing cost of running your applications in the
              cloud, you could find yourself facing an unexpected bill at the
              end of the month. Not choosing the right platform <br />
              There are many different types of cloud platforms out there, each
              with its own strengths and weaknesses. You’ll need to consider
              these carefully before making a choice; don’t fall into the trap
              of assuming that one platform is suitable for all deployments just
              because it worked well for one application or even a number.{" "}
              <br />
              <br />
              Migrating isn’t an easy feat, but cloud services are designed to
              make it a bit easier. If you consider these dos and don’ts, you
              will have a much smoother transition. Cloud migration can be
              expensive, so saving money is important to any business. This is
              especially for a small business that doesn’t want to pay for extra
              storage. <br />
