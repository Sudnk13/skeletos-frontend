              Thankfully we are done with COVID-19. This doesn’t mean that the
              virus has vanished, but Humans are the best species to adapt to
              the changes, and so do Companies too. During that pandemic period,
              all companies adopted the new culture of ‘WORK FROM HOME’. That
              era has ended too, most companies are moving away from the
              ‘Working-From-Home’ culture and adopting the ‘Hybrid’ or
              ‘Work-From-Office’ culture again.
              <br />
              <br />
              The ‘Hybrid’ or ‘Work-From-Office’ working culture brings many
              challenges to the IT Security teams. Actively collect the data
              from each laptop/desktop, verify the patches, Manage the
              anti-virus definition, Monitor all traffic that the laptop/desktop
              is negotiating with, get the report from time to time, and submit
              to CISO or Compliance manager/team for further process.
              <br />
              <br />
              There must be an Army of IT team, who is running this show and
              monitoring each and every traffic in/out from the network to make
              sure the entire office network is secured and no intruder is
              getting into the company network. Companies are spending a lot of
              money on Security products.

                According to a report by Gartner (Gartner | Delivering

                worldwide spending on information security products and services
                reached $123.8 billion in 2020, an increase of 7.6% from the
                previous year. The report also projects that spending on
                information security will continue to grow, reaching $151.2
                billion by 2023. <br />

                Another report by Cybersecurity Ventures
                (https://cybersecurityventures.com/) predicts that global

                According to a report by MarketsandMarkets
                (https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/), the global NAC market size
                is expected to grow from $1.4 billion in 2020 to $4.7 billion by
                2025, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 27.4% during
                the forecast period. This growth is being driven by increasing
                incidents of cyberattacks, strict regulations and compliance
                requirements, and the need for better visibility and control
                over network endpoints.

                NAC (Network Access Control) implementation is important for
                several reasons if companies have not implemented it yet.
              </h6>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Security: NAC implementation helps to ensure that only
                  authorized devices and users can access the network, which
                  reduces the risk of data breaches and other security
                  incidents. NAC can be used to enforce policies such as
                  endpoint security requirements, user authentication, and
                  access control.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compliance: Many industries have regulatory requirements that
                  mandate the use of NAC to protect sensitive data. For example,
                  healthcare organizations must comply with HIPAA regulations,
                  which require the use of NAC to control access to patient
                  records.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Visibility: NAC can provide valuable visibility into the
                  devices and users accessing the network, which can help IT
                  teams identify potential security risks and troubleshoot
                  network issues more efficiently.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Control: NAC implementation can give IT teams greater control
                  over the network, enabling them to enforce policies and
                  respond quickly to security incidents.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Overall, NAC implementation is an important aspect of network
                security and can help organizations protect sensitive data,
                comply with regulations, and maintain network availability and
                performance.

                In a survey conducted by Spiceworks (Business and Industry News,
                Analysis and Expert Insights – Spiceworks), a provider of IT
                management software, it was found that 60% of small and
                medium-sized businesses plan to increase their spending on
                security solutions, including NAC, in 2021. Additionally, a
                survey by ESG Research found that 74% of enterprise
                organizations have implemented or plan to implement NAC
                solutions in the next 12-24 months.
                <br />
                <br />
                These figures demonstrate that companies are recognizing the
                importance of NAC solutions in protecting their networks and
                data, and are increasing their investment in these solutions as
                part of their overall security strategy.
