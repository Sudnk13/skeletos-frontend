            </h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Enterprises are increasingly turning to multi-cloud deployment
              strategies, in which multiple public cloud providers are used to
              deploy and run enterprise applications. Multiple clouds can be
              leveraged for a variety of reasons, whether it’s to ease
              management or drive down costs. In this white paper, we will
              explore the challenges and benefits enterprises face when they
              deploy their applications across multiple clouds. <br />
              The term “multicloud” emerged around 2010 to describe a
              software-defined network (SDN) environment in which companies
              could mix and match the cloud services of different providers.
              This let organizations achieve greater flexibility and faster
              deployment, as well as faster adoption of new features and
              functionality. <br />
              <br />
              <span className="h4 text-primary">What is Multicloud</span>
              <br />
              <br />
              Multicloud is a type of cloud computing that uses more than one
              cloud service provider. <br />
              <div className="row">
                <div className="col text-center">
                  <img src={Layer2} alt="" />
                </div>
              </div>
              <br />
              The term multi-cloud can also refer to an architecture where at
              least some portion of the application is deployed on multiple
              public clouds or a combination of public and private clouds.{" "}
              <br />
              Many people are already using multi-cloud environments in their
              personal lives. For example, when you use Amazon Web Services
              (AWS) to host your website and Dropbox to store your documents,
              you’re using a multicloud solution. <br />

              Although there are many advantages to using multicloud
              architecture, it’s not without its challenges. Organizations that
              deploy multicloud solutions must be prepared for issues such as:{" "}
              <br />
              <br />
              <span className="text-warning">
                Inconsistent performance –
              </span>{" "}
              If one cloud service provider experiences an outage, your
              organization’s data may be compromised. This can cause major
              issues for companies whose entire business model depends on
              reliable access to their data. <br />

                Increased risk exposure –

              Hackers often exploit vulnerabilities in different types of
              software to gain access to sensitive information stored within
              them. If one part of your business uses Microsoft Office 365 while
              another uses Google Apps, hackers could potentially steal data
              from both platforms by hacking into either one.

              The Difference Between Hybrid cloud and multi-cloud
            </h4>
            <br />
            <br />
            Hybrid cloud implies that an IT organization is using more than one
            form of cloud computing solution – some part of their IT operation
            is running in a traditional server room or data center and another
            part is running on a public cloud. Cloud bursting refers to
            situations where an organization uses both their own servers and the
            public cloud, but only for short periods of time to handle peaks in
            demand. Both hybrid cloud and cloud bursting are real world examples
            of multicloud computing. <br />
            <br />
            Both multicloud and hybrid cloud approaches include using more than
            one cloud provider (i.e., public cloud, private cloud, etc.), but
            they differ in approach. Hybrid cloud refers to the use of two or
            more clouds belonging either to public or private domains. On the
            other hand, multicloud refers to using two or more clouds belonging
            to different providers or domains. <br />
            <br />
            For example, a company may choose one public cloud platform for its
            web traffic and another for its file storage. This is an example of
            multicloud since the two clouds are from different providers or at
            least two different products from the same provider. <br />
            <br />
            <h4 className="text-primary">Multicloud Advantages</h4>
            <p>
              The main advantage of multi-cloud is choice; choosing which
              service best suits your business needs from a variety of options
              available from multiple providers. It provides flexibility in
              terms of integrating applications and workloads into existing
              infrastructures and allows
              <br />
              <br />
              While there are many definitions, this is the most widely accepted
              one. Multicloud can be deployed for a variety of reasons,
              including:To prevent vendor lock-in, which occurs when companies
              are unable to switch cloud platforms because they cannot move
              their data and applications or would face significant costs for
              doing so
              <ul>
                <li>
                  To take advantage of regional pricing differences (e.g.,
                  cheaper storage in one region)
                </li>
                <li>
                  To avoid downtime from problems with a single cloud provider
                </li>
                <li>
                  To access capabilities not offered by a single cloud provider
                </li>
                <li>
                  To leverage best-of-breed solutions from multiple vendors
                </li>
