              Most business communication starts with the question ion What is a
              Web-Based Application ? Through previous meetings in Skeletos, we
              have understood that many Small-Size and Medium-size business
              owners like to know about What is a Web-Based Application? The
              Web-based application is software that employs web brewers and web
              technology to execute tasks over the internet. Like applications
              that help you to do the online reservation of accommodation or any
              other online services. Through a Web browser interface, users can
              interact with a remote server. Web-based applications are getting
              in demand in recent years due to various advantages as compared to
              traditional desktop apps. One of the Prominent benefits of
              Web-based applications is they are portable. If you have a
              web-based application then there is no need to install other
              software, there is no need to write a different version of
              applications by the developer because web-based applications are
              going to operate the different systems. Now let’s understand what

              languages like Java and HTML. Users can make use of multiple
              technologies and frameworks with a single web-based application.
              No matter what kind of operating system you have. Its single
              platform with many solutions like <br />
