            installing updates takes a lot of time and you might not be able to
            focus on an important task and as the number of workstation increase
            then the time for update and Installation will increase. <br />
            But when you go with Business automation, as soon as a patch or
            update is released then the system will be alert and it will be
            automatically installed, and this process will happen when employees
            are not working on the workstation. This will save you a lot of time
            and effort because no one likes to sit and watch while the system is
            getting updated. <br />
            <br />
