              Business Continuity Plan- What It Is and Why You Need One: a blog

              If youâ€™re a small business and think that disasters are only for
              large organizations, then think again. They can wreak havoc on
              your business as well. Even if your organization is not directly
              affected by a disaster, your suppliers or customers may be
              affected which can put you in trouble as well..
              <br />
              <br />
              Business continuity planning (BCP) ensures that your business can
              continue operations even when it unexpectedly encounters downtime
              or disasters. BCPs rely on two things: human actions and technical
              systems. While there are a number of technical systems that are
              usually incorporated in a BCP, email is by far the most important
              system as it serves as your primary communication channel with
              customers and business partners.
              <br />
              <br />
              The purpose of Business Continuity Planning (BCP)
              <br />
              <br />A BCP is an overarching plan that describes how an
              organization can recover from a disaster event and resume their
              operations as quickly as possible with minimal downtime. The goal
              of BCP is to prevent losses from such events and enable the
              company to remain competitive in the market even after a crisis. .
              It also determines what systems are critical for business recovery
              during downtime.
              <br />
              <br />
              Business continuity plans (BCPs) identify and prepare for threats
              to your operations, such as power outages, natural disasters,
              cyber-attacks, and other disruptions. Continuity plans also ensure
              that workers can continue to work in a safe environment.There are
              many reasons why your company needs to have a detailed business
              continuity plan in place. Here are some of them:

                  Business continuity planning is a crucial part of any
                  business, especially if your company is vulnerable to
                  large-scale disasters or other emergencies that could disrupt
                  normal operations.

                  A strategy for communicating with employees, customers and

                Creating a BCP involves:
                <li>
                  Threat Analysis: identifying threats that could disrupt the
                  flow of operations in the short-term and long-term;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Role assignment: identifying specific roles for each employee
                  and management level;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Communications: creating an internal communication strategy;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Backups: ensuring every critical function has a backup plan;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Disaster recovery: creating detailed, step-by-step plans for
                  how to recover from a disaster;
                </li>

              </ul>
              Business continuity planning is a set of activities to be
              undertaken by every organization, but specially by IT firms, to
              ensure that they can restart operations after a disaster has hit
              them. The plan is made of four phases: preparation, prevention,
              response and recovery. Even if natural disasters are the most
              common reason for having a BCP in place, it will help the firm
              from any other kind of incident or crisis that could disrupt its
              operations. Connect with us for more information.
