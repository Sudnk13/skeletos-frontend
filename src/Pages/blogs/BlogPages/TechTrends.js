              The Information Technology sector keeps adding new technologies,
              trends, and characteristics to their products. Although we cannot
              estimate what exactly will be the future trend in the IT sector,
              there are a few things from which we can easily predict the future
              of IT industry. I have listed down five major IT industry trends
              that you should also look at for enhancing your career in this
              field. AI (Artificial Intelligence) is getting smarter every day
              and it is now a reality.

              AI, as it has been introduced, is capable of understanding,
              interpreting, and even generating human language through
              unstructured information. It is considered to be the biggest
              invention since the MACRO-INVENTION of Computers. As we run
              through our lives mostly keeping to ourselves, we tend to forget
              how much things have changed in the last 50 years. Information
              technology has impacted us in ways never thought possible There
              are several major trends affecting the IT sector that would be
              worth considering while taking the future course of action. It
              will lead to the rapid growth of voice recognition and text
              analysis software.

              The opportunities for robotics are in the areas of autonomous
              systems, service robots and collaborative robots. The market for
              robotics is large. Its potential impact is to improve productivity
              and efficiency in manufacturing, construction, logistics and
              retailing and to reduce costs associated with labour, materials
              and waste disposal. Robotics has been in the industrial space for
              years; however, it has entered the consumer market as well. The
              use of robotics spans from floor-cleaning products for the home to
              bricklaying robots for the construction industry. Much investment
              is going into robotics in new domains such as agriculture,
              oceanography and space exploration. This new era of robotics
              represents an opportunity to do things that were never possible
              before and to solve problems that have always been impossibly
              difficult or even impossible—problems that require truly novel
              solutions. As robots become more capable, they will be able to
              assist people with a larger scope of activities—especially in
              areas such as transportation, service delivery, security and
              surveillance, entertainment, personal assistance and health
              care—allowing them to focus on more human-centric tasks that
              require human intelligence, creativity and emotion. <br />
              There is little doubt that robotics will continue to grow over the
              next decade, expanding into new and unexpected areas. Technology
              is still maturing and a number of challenges exist, but it is well
              understood that this will be a major area of growth in the future.
              Robotics has been a major area of investment and research for the
              past few years and will continue to be so well into the future.{" "}

              <br />
              <br />
              As technology has advanced, there will be a push to move from
              internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles
              (EVs) in the next decade. While EVs have been used for decades,
              they have been driven largely by environmental concerns. The
              technology to support EVs has improved, and concerns about the
              environment have become more widespread. What is changing is the
              actual business case for EVs and their use in personal
              transportation. In particular, advancements in battery storage and
              power management have made EVs viable for extended trips. This
              shift could create major disruption in the auto industry, similar
              to what we saw when companies like Uber entered the taxi business
              or when Amazon disrupted traditional retail business models. The
              other side of this disruption is that it will require significant
              investment in EV-supporting infrastructure from charging stations
              to power management from home outlets to centralized systems.{" "}

              This has been a huge focus for companies large and small. But,
              with every new piece of hardware, software, and service introduced
              to the market, we see it becoming more of a commodity. The same
              technology that powered the connected home is now being used in
              industrial equipment and automobiles. The same tools web
              developers use to create rich interactive websites are now being
              used to build IoT solutions. This is the commoditization of IoT.
              It’s becoming so ubiquitous that companies are able to focus less
              on what type of connected solution they’re providing and more on
              the end results they are trying to achieve. Considering the
              increasing demand of business process outsourcing and cultivating
              technology skills in India, the above-mentioned five major IT
              industry trends have a very strong scope to grow. <br />
              <br />
              The IT industry is growing day by day due to its various
              advantages, it keeps on changing which again has a positive impact
              on the growth of this field.
