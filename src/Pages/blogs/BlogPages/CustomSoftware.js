              If you are thinking of developing custom software, the very first
              question will be – “Should I do it myself or hire someone?”. As an
              experienced person in this industry, I can help answer most of
              questions by you. In this article, we are going to cover some
              challenges that every custom software development company faces on
              a daily basis. <br />
              <br />
              <span className="h5 fw-bold text-primary">
                What is Custom Software Development??
              </span>
              <br />
              Custom software development is the act of using individual
              programming languages or software to create custom applications
              for a specific company or organization. Software Developers can
              create a custom application for companies in a variety of
              industries using different programming languages or their own
              software. Many businesses require software on a regular basis, but
              not all of them are willing to invest in creating one from the
              ground up. <br />
              But why Every Business model is not developing custom software?{" "}
              <br /> SaaS, or Software as a Service is a business model where
              not the customer buys the application but instead rents it. The
              cost and responsibility of maintaining and upgrading the software
              is the responsibility of the provider. <br /> This kind of
              application service is used by many companies today and is
              becoming more and more popular. Thing is, not every business model
              can be developed into a SaaS application. There are three main
              factors that need to be taken into account when developing a SaaS
              application:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li className="text-danger">Technical Ability</li>The first factor
              to consider when developing SaaS applications is that you need to
              have the technical ability to deliver what you promise. Can you
              develop your software correctly and on time? Are you able to
              deliver a high quality product? If not, then it’s best to stick
              with selling your software as a standalone solution <br />
              <li className="text-danger">Scalability</li>If you’re planning on
              going global with your software, then scalability needs to be
              considered during development. Allowing your SaaS application to
              scale with large numbers of users means delivering an excellent
              product that will be able to cope with demand <br />
              <li className="text-danger">Profitability</li>When developing a
              SaaS application, it’s vital that you make money from it –
              otherwise, why would you develop it
            </ol>
            <br />
