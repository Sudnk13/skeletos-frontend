              An e-commerce website is a place to buy or sell goods and services
              over the internet. The e-Commerce Development Company helps in
              making a marketplace or an online shop, that can be accessed
              through the internet by potential customers or clients. An online
              shopping cart is used to help in transactions, customer details,
              inventory management and shipment tracking. Typically, an
              e-commerce website consists of secure login, purchase orders, bank
              payment gateway, order verification, and tracking. You can compare
              the e-Commerce Development Company with the general store owner
              who stocks products in his store and sells them to the customers
              over the counter. Apart from this, he acts as an intermediary
              between customer and the manufacturer by placing the order on
              their behalf. He also performs other important functions including
              packing of goods in boxes, delivery of goods to the customers door
              steps, return of money for defective products and filing claims
              for non-receivable goods against delivery partners for various
              reasons.
