              The Benefits of a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Corporate Policy: A
              blog about the benefits of bring your own device programs for
              businesses.
            </h5>
            <p>
              Bring your own device (BYOD), or bring your own technology, is an
              organizational approach in which employees are permitted to choose
              their own computing equipment for use on the job instead of having
              that equipment supplied by the company. This trend has been widely
              adopted by companies because it provides a number of advantages to
              both employees and employers. BYOD solutions provide employers
              access to select forms of technology that may facilitate greater
              flexibility for their workforce, better opportunities for cost
              savings, and a workplace that is modernized and more productive.
              They also benefit employees through the same economic benefits,
              plus increased autonomy when accessing or using their own
              technology at work. <br />
              <br />
              In today’s increasingly mobile world, the topic of BYOD security
              is an important one for IT leaders. While Bring Your Own Device
              (BYOD) policies can improve employee productivity and morale, they
              can also expose organizations to serious security risks.
            </p>
            <h5>What is BYOD?</h5>
            <p>
              For many IT departments, the challenge associated with BYOD is
              twofold: they must support a growing number of personal devices on
              their networks, while also protecting their organization’s data
              and intellectual property. The first step in doing so effectively
              is to understand what exactly BYOD means for your organization.
              <br />
              <br />
              As defined by TechTarget, “bring your own device (BYOD) is a
              policy that allows employees to bring personally owned mobile
              devices (laptops, tablets, and smart phones) to their workplace
              and access sensitive company data and applications on them.”
            </p>
            <h5>Why is BYOD Security Important?</h5>
            <p>
              IT leaders should be concerned about BYOD security since personal
              devices are likely to enter the workplace regardless of whether IT
              has approved it. By using BYOD solutions, employees can be more
              productive and motivated. However, if IT does not address this
              problem, personal devices connected to an organization’s network
              can present serious security risks.
              <br />
              <br />
              Organizations often have policies regarding the use of personal
              devices at work. But there is nothing quite as comprehensive as a
              bring your own device (BYOD) policy. A BYOD security policy
              addresses the risks associated with employees using their personal
              devices for work, and how to secure corporate data when an
              employee leaves the company or loses a device.
            </p>
            <h5>How does BYOD security work?</h5>
            <p>
              A BYOD security policy is a formalized set of rules that address
              what types of personally owned devices are approved for use at
              work, and how to protect organizational data on these devices. The
              term “bring your own device” refers to any mobile computing device
              that an employee brings into the workplace, including laptops,
              smartphones, flash drives and tablets. As consumers increasingly
              favor personal devices over company-issued ones, it’s important
              that IT departments have their own policies in place to address
              this trend.
            </p>
            <h5>What is the purpose of a BYOD security policy?</h5>
            <p>
              Most people bring their personal devices to work because they are
              more comfortable with them than company-issued ones. According to
              Gartner Research, by 2021, 90% of large enterprises will support
              some form of BYOD. With so many employees using personal devices
              for work purposes, IT must address if and how they will secure
            </p>
            <h5>Benefits and drawbacks of BYOD</h5>
            <p>
              While the concept of BYOD has been around for a decade, its recent
              rise in popularity within the workplace has been driven by the
              proliferation of smartphones and tablets. In fact, surveys show
              that employees are increasingly using their personal devices to
              access corporate networks and data.

            <ul>
              Among the benefits of supporting BYOD within your organization
              are:
              <li>
                Increasing employee productivity to 16 percent with a 40-hour
                work week, according to a study*
              </li>
              <li>
                Supporting flexible work arrangements increases employee
                satisfaction and retention
              </li>
              <li>
                Increasing employee productivity due to greater comfort and
                speed with their own devices

              <li>
                {" "}
                By increasing employee retention and job satisfaction through

                Employers using personal devices on the job may face the
                following disadvantages:
              </span>
              <li>
                Loss or theft of personal devices or the departure of employees
                may result in data breaches
              </li>
              <li>
                Personal devices do not have firewalls or anti-virus software
                installed
              </li>
              <li>
                Increasing IT costs if the department decides to support
                personal devices
              </li>
              <li>
                Lack of network security (if a device is connected to a work
                network, it could be vulnerable)
              </li>
              <li>
                Possible increased legal liability if an employee’s device is
                used to store confidential information
              </li>
              <li>
                Potential for sexual harassment and discrimination claims
                associated with emails and texts stored on personal devices
              </li>
            </ul><br />
            IT departments must have policies in place to deal with the growing
            BYOD trend and its inherent dangers. The solutions, applications and
            security mechanisms that you and your organization decide upon may
            affect a user’s ability to take their BYOD device into your
            organization. If your organization is unable to compete with BYOD,
            it is important to find ways of co-existing and capitalizing on this
            trend without impacting the way your staff work.
